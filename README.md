# Install Guide

## 1. Configuring Zypherous

### Pterodactyl method (easiest)

Warning: You need Pterodactyl already set up on a domain for this method to work

<strong>1.1</strong> Upload the file above onto a Pterodactyl NodeJS server [Download the egg from Parkervcp's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/blob/master/generic/nodejs/egg-node-js-generic.json)

<strong>1.2</strong> Unarchive the file and set the server to use NodeJS 16

### Direct method

<strong>1.1</strong> Install Node.js 16 or newer, it's recommended to install it with nvm :

- `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash`
- reopen a new ssh session (e.g., restart putty)
- `nvm install 16`
- check the node version with `node -v` and switch between versions with `nvm use <version>`

<strong>1.2</strong> Download Zypherous files in /var/www/Zypherous :

- `git clone https://github.com/urixen-org/Zypherous.git /var/www/Zypherous`

<strong>1.3</strong> Installing required node modules (and build dependencies to avoid errors) :

- `apt-get update && apt-get install libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev build-essential`
- `cd /var/www/Zypherous && npm i`

After configuring `config.yaml`, to start the server, use `node app.js`</br>
To run in the background, use PM2 (see PM2 section)</br>

## 2. Setting up webserver

<strong>2.1</strong> Copy `config-example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and configure it (specify panel domain/apikey and discord auth settings for it to work)

<strong>2.2</strong> Start the server (Ignore the 2 strange errors that might come up)

<strong>2.3</strong> Login to your DNS manager, point the domain you want your dashboard to be hosted on to your VPS IP address. (Example: dashboard.domain.com 192.168.0.1)

<strong>2.4</strong> Run `apt install nginx && apt install certbot` on the vps

<strong>2.5</strong> Run `ufw allow 80` and `ufw allow 443` on the vps

<strong>2.6</strong> Run `certbot certonly -d <Your Zypherous Domain>` then do 1 and put your email

<strong>2.7</strong> Run `nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/Zypherous.conf`

<strong>2.8</strong> Paste the configuration at the bottom of this and replace with the IP of the pterodactyl server including the port and with the domain you want your dashboard to be hosted on.

<strong>2.9</strong> Run `systemctl restart nginx` and try open your domain.

# Running in background and on startup
Installing [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2):
- Run `npm install pm2 -g` on the vps

Starting the Dashboard in Background:
- Change directory to your Zypherous folder Using `cd` command, Example: `cd /var/www/Zypherous` 
- To run Zypherous, use `pm2 start app.js --name "Zypherous"`
- To view logs, run `pm2 logs Zypherous`

Making the dashboard runs on startup:
- Make sure your dashboard is running in the background with the help of [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)
- You can check if Zypherous is running in background with `pm2 list`
- Once you confirmed that Zypherous is running in background, you can create a startup script by running `pm2 startup` and `pm2 save`
- Note: Supported init systems are `systemd`, `upstart`, `launchd`, `rc.d`
- To stop your Zypherous from running in the background, use `pm2 unstartup`

To stop a currently running Zypherous instance, use `pm2 stop Zypherous`
